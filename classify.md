      "ID": "89007637-4441-441c-ad6c-3f576aebb36f",

    }
  ]
}

Submit a Lab to Classify
------------------------
You can submit your lab's solutions as many times you want **before the lab's due date**. After the due date, it will not be possible to submit any new attempt.

The `make submit` mechanism will submit the `branch` and the `commit` ID of your latest change. It's highly recommend to create a new branch for each lab.

Below an example of the complete flow from pulling to submitting your labs:

0. Checkout into the master branch
```
git checkout master
```

1. Pull latest original `ap-labs` content. This will synchronize with the original class repository.
```
git pull origin master
```

2. Create a new branch for your current lab
```
git checkout -b my-lab-name
cd labs/my-lab-name
```

3. Have fun with your lab and make sure it compiles and runs
```
# Do your best on solving the lab
```

4. Once you are done with your code: add, commit and push your code to your remote personal copy (fork) of the original repository.
```
git add .
git commit -s -m "Solve my-lab-name"
git push myuser my-lab-name --force
```

5. Submit your work to the Classify API. This will notify the professor that your work has been completed.
Change the `demo` user to your github user account.
```
GITHUB_USER=demo make submit
```
